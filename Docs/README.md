# Indie Game Geeks

[WebUI Version: 0.6.45](https://github.com/StoicDreams/RustWebUI)

Need to flesh out a concept for this website.

## Ideas

* Online discussion forum for game development.
* Online community review forum of indie games.
* Allow members to create reviews of games - including screenshots and video
* Allow members to moderate each other.
* Allow members to rate reviews (thumbs up/down.)
